# Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Text Editor

## Progressive Web Applications are able to be used either with or without an internet connection.  When I learned about PWA's during this course I made the connection that certain web-based games must be PWA's because they advertise that one doesn't need an internet connection to play the games.

## This particular project is a PWA that functions as a text editor.  A person could install it on their mobile device and type notes into it to be referred to later.
